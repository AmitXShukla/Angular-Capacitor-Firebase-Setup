<h4>Single Codebase, Server-less or multiple platforms/database:</h4>
My goal for this Angular development environment setup is to build, real world applications using a single code base for desktop and mobile apps.<br>
I will try to setup my development environment in such way, that a single code base can serve desktop, mobile apps for different platform. Like iOS, Android, Windows and Linux desktop and mobile apps.<br>

Also, my goal is use same codebase to support different hosting and databases with minimal changes.<br>

Letâ€™s get started :-<br>
